RVX10-P: A Five-Stage Pipelined RISC-V Core supporting RV32I + 10 Custom ALU Instructions, developed under the course Digital Logic and Computer Architecture taught by Dr. Satyajit Das, IIT Guwahati.

## Project Structure

This repository contains the complete project, organized as follows:

* **/src**: Contains all Verilog/SystemVerilog source files for the processor, including `riscvpipeline.sv`, `controller.sv`, `datapath.sv`, `hazard_unit.sv`, and `forwarding_unit.sv`.
* **/tb**: Contains the testbench (`tb_pipeline.sv`) and the memory images (e.g., `rvx10_pipeline.hex`).
* **/docs**: Contains this README, the detailed `REPORT.md` (which includes a design description and hazard logic analysis), and all supporting waveform screenshots.

##  I attached a detailed report file in the docs folder.
